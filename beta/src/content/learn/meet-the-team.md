<Intro>

React development is led by a small dedicated team working full time at Meta. It also receives contributions from people all over the world.

</Intro>

## React Core {/*react-core*/}

The React Core team members work full time on the core component APIs, the engine that powers React DOM and React Native, React DevTools, and the React documentation website.

Current members of the React team are listed in alphabetical order below.

### Andrew Clark (Engineer at Meta) {/*andrew-clark*/}

    Andrew got started with web development by making sites with WordPress, and eventually tricked himself into doing JavaScript. His favorite pastime is karaoke. Andrew is either a Disney villain or a Disney princess, depending on the day.

### Jason Bonta (Engineering Manager at Meta) {/*jason-bonta*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/jasonbonta.jpg">
    Jason likes having large volumes of Amazon packages delivered to the office so that he can build forts. Despite literally walling himself off from his team at times and not understanding how for-of loops work, he is our manager, and we appreciate him for the unique qualities he brings to his work.

### Joe Savona (Engineer at Meta) {/*joe-savona*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/joe.jpg" github="josephsavona" twitter="en_JS">
    Joe was planning to major in math and philosophy but got into computer science after writing physics simulations in Matlab. Prior to React, he worked on Relay, RSocket.js, and the Skip programming language. While he’s not building some sort of reactive system he enjoys running, studying Japanese, and spending time with his family.

### Josh Story (Engineer at Vercel) {/*josh-story*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/josh.jpg" github="gnoff" twitter="joshcstory">
    Josh majored in Mathematics and discovered programming while in college.

In between that time Josh has been an IC, Manager, and Executive at a few startups. outside of work he likes to push his limits with cooking.

### Lauren Tan (Engineer at Meta) {/*lauren-tan*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/lauren.jpg" github="poteto" twitter="potetotes" personal="no.lol">
    Lauren’s programming career peaked when she first discovered the `<marquee>` tag. She’s been chasing that high ever since. When she’s not adding bugs into React, she enjoys dropping cheeky memes in chat, and playing all too many video games with her partner and dog Zelda.
</TeamMember>

### Luna Ruan (Engineer at Meta) {/*luna-ruan*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/lunaruan.jpg" github="lunaruan" twitter="lunaruan">
    Luna learned programming because she thought it meant creating video games. Instead, she ended up working on the Pinterest web app, and now on React itself. Luna doesn't want to make video games anymore, but she plans to do creative writing if she ever gets bored.
</TeamMember>

### Mofei Zhang (Engineer at Meta) {/*mofei-zhang*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/mofei-zhang.png" github="mofeiZ">
    Mofei started programming when she realized it can help her cheat in video games. She focused on operating systems in undergrad / grad school, but now finds herself happily tinkering on React. Outside of work, she enjoys debugging bouldering problems and planning her next backpacking trip(s).
</TeamMember>

### Rick Hanlon (Engineer at Meta) {/*rick-hanlon*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/rickhanlonii.jpg" github="rickhanlonii" twitter="rickhanlonii" personal="rickhanlon.codes">
    Ricky majored in theoretical math and somehow found himself on the React Native team for a couple years before joining the React team. When he's not programming you can find him snowboarding, biking, climbing, golfing, or closing GitHub issues that do not match the issue template.

### Samuel Susla (Engineer at Meta) {/*samuel-susla*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sam.jpg" github="sammy-SC" twitter="SamuelSusla">

### Sathya Gunasekaran (Engineer at Meta) {/*sathya-gunasekaran*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sathya.jpg" github="gsathya" twitter="_gsathya">

### Sebastian Markbåge (Engineer at Vercel) {/*sebastian-markbåge*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sebmarkbage.jpg" github="sebmarkbage" twitter="sebmarkbage">
    Sebastian majored in psychology. He's usually quiet. Even when he says something, it often doesn't make sense to the rest of us until a few months later. The correct way to pronounce his surname is "mark-boa-geh" but he settled for "mark-beige" out of pragmatism -- and that's how he approaches React.
</TeamMember>

### Sebastian Silbermann (Independent Engineer) {/*sebastian-silbermann*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sebsilbermann.jpg" github="eps1lon" twitter="sebsilbermann">
    Sebastian learned programming to make the browser games he played during class more enjoyable. Eventually this lead to contributing to as much open source code as possible. Outside of coding he's busy making sure people don't confuse him with the other Sebastians and Zilberman of the React community.

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/seth.jpg" github="sethwebster" twitter="sethwebster" personal="sethwebster.com">
    Seth started programming as a kid growing up in Tucson, AZ. After school, he was bitten by the music bug and was a touring musician for about 10 years before returning to *work*, starting with Intuit.

### Sophie Alpert (Independent Engineer) {/*sophie-alpert*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/sophiebits.jpg" github="sophiebits" twitter="sophiebits" personal="sophiebits.com">
    Four days after React was released, Sophie rewrote the entirety of her then-current project to use it, which she now realizes was perhaps a bit reckless. After she became the project's #1 committer, she wondered why she wasn't getting paid by Facebook like everyone else was and joined the team officially to lead React through its adolescent years. Though she quit that job years ago, somehow she's still in the team's group chats and “providing value”.

### Tianyu Yao (Engineer at Meta) {/*tianyu-yao*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/tianyu.jpg" github="tyao1" twitter="tianyu0">

### Yuzhi Zheng (Engineering Manager at Meta) {/*yuzhi-zheng*/}

<TeamMember photo="/images/team/yuzhi.jpg" github="yuzhi" twitter="yuzhiz">
